Exploring my spotify usage

## Purpose
I just want to brush up on my skills on using API requests using python. As usual, I choose something that's personal to make things more interesting to work with, music!

### To-do
- Get data on user-related endpoints
- Export data out as json
- Visualize the data in the form of a table 

## Methodology
Data Mining with Python: 
- I didn't quite understand the Spotify API documentation so I googlged around and got an idea from the following github (https://stmorse.github.io/journal/spotify-api.html). 
- My bestie also slowly walked me through the entire Authorization Flow process to help me understand each step (thank you, Dorfnoxüôèüèª)
- Once data mining is complete, I export that as json file.

Data Visualization:
- Using javaScript and HTML/CSS (& thank you bootstrap as usual), a data table is created to show song title with spotify-webplayer embedded URL, artist, album, duration and popularty (according to Spotify documentation, this number is based on some algorithm. Not a lot of explanation there, but I use it anyway!)
- Filter options are also available to search specific song title, artist or year. I did not find it meaningful to do a search by the album name.

## Future Project
Seeing a table with a search filter like this makes me want a table to my singing project. I am definitely making one!
