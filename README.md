Exploring my spotify usage

## Purpose
I just want to brush up on my skills on using API requests using python. As usual, I choose something that's personal to make things more interesting to work with, music!

### Some ideas in mind
- Get data on user-related endpoints
- load them into data dictionary or load them in database
- call on those data to make some viz or table? 

## Methodology
Data Mining with Python: 
- I didn't quite understand the Spotify API documentation so I googlged around and got an idea from the following github (https://stmorse.github.io/journal/spotify-api.html). 
- My bestie also slowly walked me through the entire Authorization Flow process to help me understand each step (thank you, Dorfnoxüôèüèª)
